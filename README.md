## Introduction

Welcome to a guided tour of one of the most comprehensive and advanced home lab setups you'll likely encounter. Designed with meticulous attention to detail and an evident depth of understanding of computing, networking, and cybersecurity, this home lab serves as a practical, educational, and experimental platform for a myriad of I.T. disciplines.

## Raspberry Pi Cluster: The Backbone

**Trio of Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB RAM**

The cluster includes three Raspberry Pi 4 Model B devices, each boasting 8GB of RAM. One of these serves as the main external SSH connection server running Kali Linux Purple. This primary SSH server acts as a gateway, enabling users to connect to the other Raspberry Pis, including one running Ubuntu that serves as a general-purpose server, and another that is the powerhouse "Super Pi."

### Advanced SSH Tunneling and Networking

- The home lab network now leverages the ASUS RT-AX82U AX5400 Dual-Band WiFi 6 router for enhanced SSH tunneling and networking capabilities. Here's how the updated setup works:

- External SSH Connection: External SSH connections are directed to a high-numbered port on the main household router. The ASUS RT-AX82U, hardwired to the primary router, forwards these connections to the dedicated SSH server (Super Pi) within the home lab.

- Secure Tunneling: The ASUS RT-AX82U provides a robust and secure tunnel for SSH traffic. With advanced QoS and AiProtection Pro features, it ensures that SSH connections are prioritized and protected from external threats.

- Optimized Networking: All servers within the lab are connected to a Cisco Nexus 3048 network switch with 48 1Gb ports and 4 SFP+ 10Gb ports. The previous 4-port switch has been replaced with this more robust and high-performance solution. The Cisco Nexus 3048 switch has dual 400W PSUs and upgraded system fans with Noctua 40mm 12V PWM fans for quieter operation.

- This updated network configuration offers a significant improvement over the previous Pi Router setup, providing higher speeds, enhanced security, and a more stable connection for all SSH and networking tasks within the lab.

### Specialized Roles for Each Pi

Each Raspberry Pi in the cluster is purpose-built to perform a specialized function. From SSH tunneling, routing via OpenWRT, to server roles on Ubuntu and Kali Linux, the system's modular approach not only makes management easier but also ensures efficient resource utilization.

### The "Super Pi"

Among these devices is the standout "Super Pi"â€”a Raspberry Pi equipped with 8GB of RAM and a 1TB SATA3 M.2 SSD. It's not just a Pi; it's a miniature powerhouse designed to handle data-intensive tasks and computational operations that would traditionally necessitate a full-scale server.

### Monitoring and Reliability

A Raspberry Pi Pico W is seamlessly integrated into the system to monitor its health. This microcontroller pings the servers every 3 minutes as a "keep-alive," ensuring uninterrupted and efficient operations.

### Power and Cooling

The individual 20W power supplies and cooling solutions for each Raspberry Pi highlight a meticulous attention to detail, emphasizing longevity and optimal performance.

of power.

### Diverse Storage Options

The WD Black SN770 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD ensures rapid access to frequently used data. Additionally, two 1TB WD Black HDDs in a RAID 1 (mirroring) configuration offer ample storage space with enhanced performance and redundancy.

### Graphics and Cooling

The Gigabyte Geforce RTX 4060 Ti GPU affords the potential for GPU-accelerated computing tasks. Coupled with seven case fans and a tower cooler, this guarantees that every component maintains optimal temperature ranges.

## Laptop as Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) and Windows Server

### Secondary Server

Sporting a 4-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 500GB storage, this laptop doubles as a Direct-Attached Storage (DAS) device and a host for a Windows sandbox server, which allows for isolated testing and experimentation.

### Unique Network Architecture

While the Raspberry Pis connect to their dedicated router, the main desktop links to the primary household router. The laptop, functioning as DAS, is integrated into the Raspberry Pi network. An Ethernet connection between the main desktop and the laptop establishes a direct link, enabling high-speed data transfers and smooth interactions across the two distinct network environments.

### Operating Systems

#### Windows 10 Pro

Windows 10 Pro runs on both the desktop and the laptop, enhancing the home lab's capabilities. Features such as BitLocker, advanced Windows Defender functionalities, and Hyper-V for virtualization transform these Windows machines into powerful extensions of an already advanced home lab setup.
